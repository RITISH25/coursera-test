<h1> <p>Institutions and Actors in Foreign Policy Decision Making in India
</p>
Let us now turn our attention to the core of the subject of my lecture today. Who makes Foreign Policy in India?
If I were to ask today’s audience, the answers would likely be Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) or the Prime
Minister’s Office (PMO) or the PM himself. The simple answer is that no single institution or personality can be
attributed with having exclusive rights or influence in this area. At different times, one or the other may have
been dominant, but as we shall soon see, there are several contributing actors, who collectively build up what
we tend to term as India’s Foreign Policy Consensus, which has the backing of the majority of the political
leadership of the country, both of the ruling dispensation and those in the opposition.
Who then are these actors, influencers and makers of India’s foreign policy? Let us dwell briefly on each.
Ministry of External Affairs (MEA)
It is true that MEA is the pivotal player in India’s external or foreign relations. A look at the ‘Allocation of
Business Rules’ of GOI shows that MEA has been empowered with the task of planning, formulating and
managing India’s external relations with other nations to protect and promote national interests in the global
stage. Given this basic directive one may mistakenly assume that MEA is the sole agent charged with making
India’s foreign policy. In reality, MEA acts like the foreign policy secretariat in India, which receives numerous
policy inputs from various sources, and analyzes and channelizes the different options to the political
leadership, i.e., the Cabinet headed by the PM, and then implements decisions taken at this apex level.
Inputs come from information gathering primarily by Indian Diplomatic Missions (Embassies, High
Commissions and Permanent Representative Offices) abroad. Other sources are relevant ministries,
departments and agencies in India, from think tanks and research centres like the IDSA and IWCA, from trade
and industry associations like CII, FICCI and ASSOCHAM, from academic institutions, and from individual subject
specialists. After processing and analysis, the MEA’s views and options approved by the External Affairs Minister
(EAM) are forwarded to the Cabinet/Cabinet Committee for consideration. The Policy Planning and Research
Division of MEA is the coordinating point. Notes for Cabinet are initiated by the concerned territorial or
functional division.
In line with issues that have become important in recent times, MEA has established specialized divisions
catering to Counter Terrorism, Cyber Diplomacy, E-Governance, etc,. Since the late 1980s, MEA has been
strengthening its economic diplomacy capabilities with divisions dealing with investment and technology
promotion, now subsumed into its Economic Diplomacy Division, a division looking after Multilateral Economic
Relations (MER) and specialized centres for our ties with ASEAN and BIMSTEC, which are primarily focused on
strengthening economic ties. A Development Partnership Administration (DPA) was created a few years ago, to
bring together all elements involved in India’s role as a preferred assistance partner to developing countries
particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The D&ISA Division has been in existence for over three decades
dealing with nuclear proliferation, disarmament and related issues, including India’s bid for membership of the
Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and related bodies. Functional divisions like Administration, Establishment,
Finance and Legal and Treaties, provide the tools and environment needed by Indian diplomats at home and
abroad to discharge their functions effectively. </h1>
